                    History <br>
                    Since childhood, I have been curious about <br>
                    what was beyond my sight, so I <br>
                    always took apart toys to see what <br>
                    was inside. After taking out the contents, <br>
                    I tried to make something new. What <br>
                    I came up with was a fan.<BR>

                    from school and have been working for <br>

                    few weeks ago, I enrolled in college <br>
                    10x where I study front-end development.
