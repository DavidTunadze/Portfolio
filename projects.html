                <p> 
                    My first website that I created only <br>
                    in html. Here is information about a <br>
                    specific car that is my favorite. History <br>
                    about the car, who and why it <br>
                    was created, in which years it was <br>
                    produced, Different tuning versions, acceleration, power, <br> and so on.

                    This is my second website where I <br>
                    used html & css. Here are three <br>
                    DJs whose music I liked when I <br>
                    created the site and I included brief <br>
                    information about them. I also added a <br>
                    search box and a nav bar to the site.

                    This is my third website that I <br>
                    have adapted to my work environment. The <br>
                    first time I wanted to create a <br>
                    few pages in html and beautify them <br>
                    with a single css page, but the <br>
                    final result is this. I have already <br>
                    refined the html & css.
